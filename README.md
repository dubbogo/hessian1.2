## readme
---
The hessian package refers to [xjing521/gohessian](https://github.com/xjing521/gohessian). Thanks for [xjing521](https://github.com/xjing521)'s great work.

## client_test ##
---
I could not find gohesssian mock server for client_test.go. So I write a [hessian server](github.com/AlexStocks/dubbogo-examples/calculator) in Java referring to [chenluyj/gohessian/test](https://github.com/chenluyj/gohessian/tree/master/test).
